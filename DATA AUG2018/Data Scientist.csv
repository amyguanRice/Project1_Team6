WHO WE ARE LOOKING FOR:

Changing the established guidelines of an industry, especially one as rooted as digital advertising, isn't an easy or quick effort, but we believe it's the right thing to do and we want to be the ones to do it. We're looking for hungry people who are passionate about redefining the digital video and media world, from how consumers experience it to how content creators fund it.

We work hard at true[X], and we believe in fostering an open, collaborative, motivating, creative culture for our team; put simply, our employees love to come to work. We have all the perks you can expect from a startup environment, including a sunlit rooftop patio, corn hole and ping pong, and a stocked pantry and fridge.

The true[X] technology team is a bit of an anomaly in the tech world: Once people join us, they tend to stick around. Our leadership has been a part of this company for 10+ years (since the beginning), and our turnover is exceptionally low.

You can ask individual members their thoughts, but this dedication generally comes down to two factors. First, the people: We hire smart, driven, accountable, and friendly individuals. We all appreciate and are proud of the culture weâve created here, and itâs in no small part due to our high hiring standards. Second (and this point cannot be understated): There is a endless supply of engaging engineering work to be done. Our engineers are constantly expanding their knowledge and experience, whether it be exploring a new language on a hackday, learning the internals of various cloud platforms, or leveraging new tools to work with our âBig (and growing!) Data"". Boredom doesnât exist here.

Our leadership takes pride in fostering a sustainable software development cadence. No artificial deadlines. No guilting our team into staying late. And no micromanagement. We use the best tools to get the job done, end of story. We communicate via Slack (mostly emojis and gifs, really). We like testing. We have an aversion to meetings. You get the hardware you prefer (within reason) to make you as productive as possible. We want you to be happy, and stay a valuable team member for a long time to come.

As a Data Scientist, you will be joining one of the most innovative teams at true[X]. As an AdTech company, data is our lifeblood, and there's a lot of it. Every data scientist wants to get his/her hands on large and interesting data sets, and we can deliver that and more. We do cutting edge ad optimization, and that's the tip of the iceberg. If you've wanted to join a team where your work can really have an effect, youâve found the right place.

RESPONSIBILITIES:
Leverage ""Big Dataâ?tools (Spark/Hadoop Ecosystem) and cloud services to build ETL pipelines for the massive and complex data collected on true[X]âs proprietary ad platform and by third-party vendors. Ensure data quality throughout all stages of acquisition and processing, including data sourcing, cleansing, normalization, transformation, mapping, etc. Develop statistical methods and data mining algorithms to solve difficult, non-routine analysis problems and provide insights to various internal and external stakeholders.
Research and implement novel machine learning and deep learning methods. Deliver a machine learning project from beginning to end, including validating needs, specifying the requirements, defining an approach, aggregating and exploring data, building and validating models, deploying completed models, and using the results to deliver business impact to true[X].
Write production-level codes (Python/Scala/C++) to implement machine learning models at scale. Work with QA/platform/software engineers to test and deploy the models to cloud-hosting ad serves. Monitor the model performance and efficiency in real time, diagnose and resolve potential production issues, and improve as needed.
Interact cross-functionally with a wide range of people and teams. Collaborate with colleagues from engineering, business and art backgrounds. Present proposals and results in a clear manner backed by data and coupled with actionable conclusions.
Provide direction and guidance to more junior members of team on all aspects of data science from business context to technical coaching.
REQUIREMENTS:
Advanced degree in machine learning, optimization, or relevant fields
In-depth understanding of modern machine learning models and their mathematical underpinning
Minimum 5 years of working experience in the areas of machine learning, predictive modeling and data mining
Proven track record of customizing machine learning solutions to business problems in a cross functional team

Utilize programming skills to design and implement tools directly related to biological research. Analyzes experimental data, addresses methodological problems in experimental protocols and results. Uses discretion in prioritizing and organizing workflow and in optimizing methodologies and results.

RESEARCH BACKGROUND AND GOALS

The Corradin lab is seeking an enthusiastic and motivated individual who is interested in utilizing their big data analytic skills to answer fundamental questions about the genetics of human disease. Determining genetic variants that predispose to common disease provides essential insights into the pathogenesis of human disorders. Rather than impact protein-coding genes, the majority of the genetic risk to disease alters the function of regulatory elements. Regulatory elements are noncoding regions of the genome that play a critical role in controlling gene expression programs. Gene regulation is what enables different cell types of the human body to have diverse functions, thus genetic variants that disrupt this process can have dire consequences for human health.

The Corradin lab is focused on evaluating how DNA variants can work in cooperation to impact gene expression and alters one's risk to developing a disease. This requires high-throughput analysis of datasets that involve tens to hundreds of thousands of individuals' genetic information. This position offers a unique and challenging opportunity to utilize big data, machine learning and other computational skills to study important aspects of human health and disease. The lab studies a variety of human disorders including multiple sclerosis, cancer and substance abuse disorders.

3837,Data Scientist,New York Life Insurance Co,"New York Life Insurance Company (âNew York Lifeâ?or âthe companyâ? is the largest mutual life insurance company in the United States*. Founded in 1845, New York Life is headquartered in New York City, maintains offices in all fifty states, and owns Seguros Monterrey New York Life in Mexico.
New York Life is one of the most financially strong and highly capitalized insurers in the business. The company reported 2016 operating earnings of $1.954 billion. Total assets under management at year end 2016, with affiliates, totaled $538 billion. As of year-end 2016, New York Lifeâs surplus was $23.336 billion**. New York Life holds the highest possible financial strength ratings currently awarded to any life insurer from all four of the major ratings agencies: A.M. Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moodyâs Aaa; Standard &amp; Poorâs AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16).
Financial strength, integrity and humanityâthe values upon which New York Life was foundedâhave guided the companyâs decisions and actions for over 170 years.
New York Life, the largest writer of retail life insurance in the U.S. and a top player in annuities, long-term care and mutual funds, is seeking a Lead Data Scientist in its Center for Data Science and Analytics.

The company has over 150 years of history and while usable data does not quite go back this far, we have a wealth of internal information on consumers, policies and their performance, as well as applicants, prospects and our 10,000 agents. We also have a multitude of external data from a great variety of sources. New York Life is likely the most data-rich company in the life insurance industry. Analytical challenges range from mortality risk (with a number of both medical and non-medical components) to agent recruiting decisions, consumer analytics (segmentation, response, conversion, retention, up-sell), fraud detection and digital advertising placement.

The Center for Data Science and Analytics is the innovative corporate Analytics group within New York Life. We are a rapidly growing entrepreneurial department which aims to design, create and offer innovative data-driven solutions for many parts of the enterprise. We are aided by New York Lifeâs existing business with a large market share in individual life insurance. We have the freedom to explore external data sources and new statistical techniques, and are excited about delivering a whole new generation of Analytical solutions.

In fact, we are designing and will build one of the first multivariate model-based continuous risk differentiations in the industry. This model will incorporate current underwriting best practices (including medical rules) as features and add other data sources, patterns/ideas and variables to essentially create a rating plan to support the next generation underwriting process at New York Life. This is just one of several projects with large business value. Geographic analytics on agents and customers, application fraud detection, agent success prediction and client prospecting analytics (off-line and on-line) are other exciting examples of enormous incremental value from analytics. Our products will be implemented into real-time core business processes and decisions that drive the company (e.g. underwriting, pricing, agent recruiting, prospecting, new product development).

We work with data ranging from demographics, credit and geo data to detailed medical data (medical test results, diagnosis, prescriptions) and social media information. We have a modern computing environment with a solid suite of data science/modeling tools and packages, and a large (but manageable) group of well-trained professionals at various levels to support you. Life insurance is on the verge of huge change. This is a chance to be part of, actually to drive, the transformation of an industry. Is this not why we became data scientists?

You will apply your highly developed analytical skills to work on all aspects of the life insurance value chain, ranging from risk models, fraud detection, process triaging, and marketing predictions to a variety of other analytics solutions.

You will apply your technical data/ETL/programming skills to ingest, wrangle and explore external and internal data to create reports, function as the data expert and prepare data for modeling and support production deployment of models OR apply your technical modeling skills to build world-class predictive models for solving tangible business problems.

Staff have also developed expertise in and conduct research on the intersection of emergency preparedness and primary care with a focus on reducing primary care access deficits post-disaster. As part of the policy focused work, HP has been analyzing, monitoring, and weighing in on the implementation of the insurance expansion components of the Affordable Care Act and NY's state-based Marketplace from the perspective of low-income and vulnerable populations. This position will have a portfolio of research, data analysis and evaluation responsibilities that provides support across the Bureau.

4248,Data Scientist,Slice,"What is Slice?

Slice is the leading technology and marketing platform made exclusively for local pizzerias, making it super easy to order delicious, authentic local pizza anywhere, anytime. We serve the $45 billion U.S. pizzeria market in two ways: by providing a pizza-centric mobile and web ordering experience for consumers, and by empowering local restaurants with the technology, tools, and marketing to grow their business, while helping them compete with Big Pizza. Can you imagine what a small mom and pop pizza shop could achieve with the resources of Dominoâs?

Slice was born in 2010 and has quietly bootstrapped its way to building a network of more than 8,000 pizzerias nationwide. Ilir Sela ( https://www.forbes.com/sites/amyfeldman/2018/04/10/pizza-unchained-tech-startup-slice-helps-local-pizzerias-get-online-and-fight-back-against-dominos/#7058d5a11263 ), our founder and CEO, started the company as a passion project to help his friends and family in the pizza business, but he quickly saw a massive opportunity to champion these small businesses by bringing their bites to the masses. Ilir has since built an amazing team of operators, marketers, technologists, and investors â?all dedicated to making it easier for people to enjoy their favorite local pizza. Did you see we were recently Appleâs App of the Day ( https://www.linkedin.com/feed/update/urn: li: activity: 6388024479095750656 )?

We created Slice to champion the small mom and pop pizzerias by connecting those proud makers with customers who are just as passionate about their pizza. We celebrate pizza as the ultimate shareable food that brings people together for more than just a bite. So whether you call it a pizza parlor, slice joint, or pizzeria, we're here to help you order authentic local pizza, connect to your community, and live your best slice life.

Founded in 1845, New York Life is headquartered in New York City, maintains offices in all fifty states, and owns Seguros Monterrey New York Life in Mexico.
New York Life is one of the most financially strong and highly capitalized insurers in the business. The company reported 2016 operating earnings of $1.954 billion. Total assets under management at year end 2016, with affiliates, totaled $538 billion. As of year-end 2016, New York Lifeâs surplus was $23.336 billion**. New York Life holds the highest possible financial strength ratings currently awarded to any life insurer from all four of the major ratings agencies: A.M. Best, A++; Fitch AAA; Moodyâs Aaa; Standard &amp; Poorâs AA+. (Source: Individual Third Party Ratings Report as of 8/17/16).
Financial strength, integrity and humanityâthe values upon which New York Life was foundedâhave guided the companyâs decisions and actions for over 170 years.
Lead Data Scientist

New York Life, the largest writer of retail life insurance in the U.S. and a top player in annuities, long-term care and mutual funds, is seeking a Lead Data Scientist in its Center for Data Science and Analytics.

The company has over 150 years of history and while usable data does not quite go back this far, we have a wealth of internal information on consumers, policies and their performance, as well as applicants, prospects and our 10,000 agents. We also have a multitude of external data from a great variety of sources. New York Life is likely the most data-rich company in the life insurance industry. Analytical challenges range from mortality risk (with a number of both medical and non-medical components) to agent recruiting decisions, consumer analytics (segmentation, response, conversion, retention, up-sell), fraud detection and digital advertising placement.

The Center for Data Science and Analytics is the innovative corporate Analytics group within New York Life. We are a rapidly growing entrepreneurial department which aims to design, create and offer innovative data-driven solutions for many parts of the enterprise. We are aided by New York Lifeâs existing business with a large market share in individual life insurance. We have the freedom to explore external data sources and new statistical techniques, and are excited about delivering a whole new generation of Analytical solutions.

In fact, we are designing and will build one of the first multivariate model-based continuous risk differentiations in the industry. This model will incorporate current underwriting best practices (including medical rules) as features and add other data sources, patterns/ideas and variables to essentially create a rating plan to support the next generation underwriting process at New York Life. This is just one of several projects with large business value. Geographic analytics on agents and customers, application fraud detection, agent success prediction and client prospecting analytics (off-line and on-line) are other exciting examples of enormous incremental value from analytics. Our products will be implemented into real-time core business processes and decisions that drive the company (e.g. underwriting, pricing, agent recruiting, prospecting, new product development).

We work with data ranging from demographics, credit and geo data to detailed medical data (medical test results, diagnosis, prescriptions) and social media information. We have a modern computing environment with a solid suite of data science/modeling tools and packages, and a large (but manageable) group of well-trained professionals at various levels to support you. Life insurance is on the verge of huge change. This is a chance to be part of, actually to drive, the transformation of an industry. Is this not why we became data scientists?

Position Summary:
We have an exciting opportunity to join our team as a Research Data Associate.

In this role, the successful candidate Research assistant for exploring the mental and cognitive experience of cardiac arrest, including near-death experiences with Dr. Sam Parnia.
The NYU Resuscitation Research Group is a newly established multi-disciplinary group that aims to identify novel methods to save the lives and brains of people who undergo cardiac arrest resuscitation. The complications of cardiac arrest include brain injury, disorders of consciousness and neurocognitive deficits. However, it is increasingly recognized that a systematic approach to cardiac arrest and post-resuscitation care can significantly improve survival, neurological and neurocognitive outcomes. This knowledge, combined with the significant social and medical impact of this condition on human lives, has led to the development of a clinical and research program towards combatting this condition.
Following the advent of modern cardiopulmonary resuscitation (CPR) for cardiac arrest (CA), millions of people have survived CA, and many people have provided anecdotal reports of lucid well-structured thought processes with memory formation from a period during CA, including so called near death experiences. In recent years, the accuracy of these reports, have been further supported by evidence from case studies, and more recently large scale prospective CA studies. The occurrence of consciousness at the time CA is highly significant, as data from independent studies indicate that brain function ceases during CA. We are one of the few centers with an established track record of research into real-time non-invasive monitoring of brain resuscitation during CA, as well as the study of consciousness/awareness and the cognitive and mental experience of CA.

This multi-centered, prospective and retrospective study investigates the detailed cognitive recollections of cardiac arrest survivors using a mixed methods approach that integrates quantitative and qualitative research. This study aims to understand conscious awareness and/or mental cognitive states during cardiac arrest/circulatory standstill while examining their relationship with markers of brain resuscitation. Furthermore, we plan to establish themes that relate to the experience of cardiac arrest and their impact on neuropsychological outcomes and quality of life.

Job Responsibilities:
collaborate with the Resuscitation Research team in attending cardiac arrest events where real-time brain monitoring data is collected. After such an event, the student will be responsible for follow up and interviews of cardiac arrest survivors to determine the mental and cognitive experience of cardiac arrest and its impact on neuropsychological outcomes and the quality of life in survivors.

The best optimization R&amp;D role- period.

The context: Amazon ships millions of unique shipments through its Fulfillment Network. Product is procured from tens of thousands of vendors, third party sellers into the multiple fulfillment centers in the Amazon network. Merchandise from these vendors needs to be transported from vendor locations to these fulfillment centers and between fulfillment centers as we balance our inventory across our network. Amazon has the largest selection â?merchandise is associated with varying dimensions, restrictions and shipping costs â?this selection is key to Amazonâs virtuous cycle for growth. Post purchase by customers, we are responsible for transportation of shipments from fulfillment centers to customers; this involves moving shipments from our fulfillment centers to sortation centers and delivery depots. This results in a gigantic graph, with the nodes being vendors, Amazon.com fulfillment centers, sort centers, delivery depots and end customers. The arcs in this graph represent the time of transportation and cost of transportation. Each node has a specific capacity, and so does each arc, and there are time constraints on when a product needs to ship out of a node and when it needs to come into a different node. And Amazon needs to do all of this while incurring the least cost, this presents a great opportunity to leverage large scale network optimization models to drive decision making processes.

Modeling and Optimization team is responsible for building network optimization models and analytic tools that improve the economics of the North American, European, and Asian fulfillment networks as Amazon increases the speed and decreases the cost to deliver product to customers. We are looking for motivated individuals with strong numerical optimization and analysis skills to join our team focusing on transportation network modeling and design. You will be responsible for building tools to determine the means to efficiently transport shipments from vendors to our fulfillment centers, as well as from fulfillment centers to our customers. In particular, you will focus on building models that will be leveraged to drive the optimization of the transportation infrastructure, transportation contract negotiation, increase speed of delivery and evaluate opportunities to decrease cost through new initiatives. Some of the key job responsibilities
Own the strategic planning and research initiatives involved with the transportation network including network optimization, process improvement and sizing up opportunities from new initiatives. Build prototypes to demonstrate the benefits from proposed changes to the decision systems and operational processes.

Partner closely with business and IT groups. Provide analysis using mathematical modeling tools to benchmark existing operations/processes as well as to identify opportunities for improvement. Work closely with IT teams in enhancing the prototypes and implementing them in our production environment.
Effectively communicate with senior management as well as with colleagues from computer science, operations research and business backgrounds.

5092,Data Scientist,Rover,"Who we are:

Rover.com connects pet parents with the nationâs largest network of pet sitters and dog walkers. On Rover, pet parents can easily discover, book, and manage personalized care for their dogs including pet sitting, dog walking, and doggy day care. Founded in 2011 on the belief that everyone should have the opportunity to experience the unconditional love of a dog, Rover improves and simplifies life for pet parents and the dogs they love.

We're headquartered in downtown Seattle. We're an agile, fast-growing startup, and our leadership comes from some of the country's most respected tech companies. Our Senior Leadership team has been recognized by Forbes, Seattle Business, and Geekwire. We've been named among Seattle's ""Best Places to Work"" in Seattle Met magazine, Seattle Business Magazine, and the Puget Sound Business Journal in 2016 and 2017. We're also the recipient of Worldâs Most Dog-Friendly Offices in 2016 by Inc.com. Needless to say (but we're going to say it anyway)âwe love dogs, and we wouldn't dream of going to work without them by our sides.

Who we're looking for:

The Senior Data Scientist at Rover will possess broad enough experience to contribute to each of the three classes of problem outlined above, while also being deep enough to lead at least one of them end-to-end. In every case, and regardless of the specific techniques employed, the Senior Data Scientist will be responsible for managing long-running experiments with significant impact on how users interact with Rover.com, participate in our marketplace, and find care for their dogs. This is a non-trivial responsibility: on the one hand, there is tremendous value to be driven in continuing to optimize the Rover marketplace, while on the other hand the opportunity cost associated with long-running experiments (in time and dollars) is very high.

For this reason, real-world experience in this class of problem is a requirement, and experience working in an online marketplace specifically is strongly preferred.

What does Data Science mean at Rover?

There are three broad classes of core Data Science problems with which we are engaged at Rover:

1. Multivariate modeling: the creation of models that lead to better search outcomes, providing better matches between dog sitters and owners. Here, success is measured in terms of impact on marketplace efficiency

2. Machine learning: the ongoing development of the machine learning infrastructure that enables continuous learning from our data, where success is also measured in terms of marketplace efficiency gains as well as the rate at which different aspects of the user experience are incorporated into our ML systems

3. Scaling user testing: the parallelization and democratization of end-user testing across all aspects of the product and user experience, where success is measured in terms of testing velocity across the organization
Your Toolset Includes:
SQL
Python
Probably at least one additional programming language / computational programming environment; e.g., R, Matlab, C++, etc
Google Analytics or similar user funnel analytics tools
Tableau, Looker, or similar data visualization tools
Data-informed decision making with rigorous split testing.
Integrated teams with developers, designers and analysts working side-by-side.
Your Qualifications:
B.S in a quantitative discipline required; advanced degree (MS or PhD) preferred
Strong technical and coding skills
Deep expertise in one or more core data science disciplines (e.g, supervised learning, machine learning, etc)
Marketplace experience strongly preferred
Experience in online user testing strongly preferred
Why Weâll Hire You:
You are familiar with more than just the basics, and have more than cursory experience with at least sub-discipline in the broad field of data science. In other words, you know where the sharp edges are, and can lead decisions around what techniques are and are not appropriate to employ for particular classes of problem
Youâre a deeply analytical thinker who is passionate about finding structure in data, and using data to drive real value to the end user (and thus the business).
You are passionate about our core business. You will instinctively dig into every aspect of what it means to be a dog sitter and a dog owner on the Rover platform.
You can take abstractly defined problems and work with (imperfect) data to drive decisions
You are a great partner to engineers and business owners alike
You can pitch your own ideas and shepherd them through to completion
You show pattern of being self-started, self-taught and self-directed
You favor open communication with willingness to ask and answer questions
You are output- and outcome-oriented
You have excellent written and verbal communication skills
You play nicely with others (and dogs)
Benefits of Working at Rover.com:
Competitive compensation
401k
Stock options
4 weeks paid time off
Competitive benefits package, including medical, dental, and vision insurance
Commuter benefits
Bring your dog to work (and unlimited puppy time)
Doggy benefits, including $1000 toward adopting your first dog
Stocked fridges, coffee, soda, and lots of treats (for humans and dogs)
Free catered lunches semi-monthly

Create the model that transforms an industry
********************************************

Want to bring a $15B sector of the insurance industry into the 21st century? Yearning for a startup built around machine learning? Join States Title and send an entirely new type of real estate model into the wild.

Every mortgage or refinance transaction needs title insurance. The current incumbents pay only 5% of their intake as claims; they spend about 85% running a manual process that involves frequent paper searches and phone calls for millions of mortgages every year.

States Title is modernizing this antiquated process and will scale rapidly to grab a large fraction of the market. By bringing data science to title insurance, we can repurpose those wasted billions towards making homeownership easier and less risky, helping people invest time and money into more meaningful parts of their lives.

*************************************************
We're growing our data science team at all levels
*************************************************

As a data scientist at States Title, you'll take part in a fun, diverse, and respectful corporate atmosphere. You'll interact frequently with an executive team that has significant accomplishments at The White House, Google, McKinsey, and Capital One behind them. Much more than a model builder, you'll talk directly with VP+ customers and stakeholders, vet and negotiate deals with vendors, recommend strategies to change the direction of the company, and discuss data stewardship and model governance with deep legal minds in the public and private sectors.

We're proud of the sophisticated data ingestion process we have built, as well as the multi-model ecosystem that is already live, with its parts working together to orchestrate an instant insurance decision in a robust, well-managed, and well-tested way. We have high expectations of communication, accountability, and mathematical rigor, and are looking for those who would be inspired and stimulated in such an environment.

Fintech: you've built credit risk, fraud, or insurance models or algorithms and worked with engineering teams to deploy them
Academia: you've used real-world data to publish highly cited peer-reviewed journal articles on prediction or inference using open source tools
Series A and Series B start-up environments: you've served a catch-all analytics role doing everything from data cleaning to SQL joins to building predictive models
Strengths aligned with our needs
Theoretical background relevant to data science (e.g. Can you explain how to build a random forest without making reference to computers?)
Technical skills (e.g. When you write a python library that tests the score distribution of incoming orders against expectation, does Engineering praise the quality of your code?)
Creative skills (e.g. When out-of-the-box regression on a continuous target isn't good enough, can you come up with a customized loss function for the problem?)
Collaboration skills (e.g. Can you get a group to make a controversial decision in fewer than 30 minutes?)
